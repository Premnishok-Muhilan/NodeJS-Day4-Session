The line app.use(express.json()); is used in an Express.js application

app.use() is a method provided by the Express application object (app) to
register middleware functions. Middleware functions are functions that have
access to the request (req), response (res), and the next middleware function
in the application’s request-response cycle.

express.json() is a built-in middleware function provided by Express that
parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.

Parsing JSON:
When a client sends a request with a Content-Type header set to application/json,
express.json() will automatically parse the JSON data in the request body.
After parsing, the resulting JavaScript object is available in req.body. 
This allows you to easily access and work with the data sent in the request.

Simplifies handling and processing of JSON data sent in HTTP requests, making it easier to build APIs
and handle incoming data in a structured way.

  1.Route Path: The first argument specifies the URL path that this route will handle.
    In this case, "/" indicates the root path of the application.
  2.Callback Function: The second argument is a callback function that will be executed
    whenever a GET request is made to the specified path. 
    This function takes two parameters:
        1.request: An object representing the incoming request.
          It contains information about the request, such as query parameters,
          headers, and the request body.
        2.response: An object used to send a response back to the client.

          response status.

/*import todoRouter
Router Module: The todoRoutes module is expected to export an Express router object.

app.use() is a method provided by the Express application object (app) to
register middleware functions.
Path: The first argument specifies the URL path prefix that the middleware
or router should handle.
Middleware/Router: The second argument is the middleware function or router
object that should be used for requests to the specified path.
Path Prefix: This string specifies the path prefix that will be used to match
incoming requests. In this case, it means that any request starting with
/api/v1/todos will be handled by the todoRouter.

todoRouter:
    Router Object: This is an instance of an Express router that you have imported
    from another module (e.g., ./routes/todoRoutes). It contains route definitions
    and middleware specific to handling requests related to todos.
    Functionality: The todoRouter is set up to handle requests to various endpoints
    under the /api/v1/todos path.

When you use app.use("/api/v1/todos", todoRouter);, Express will:
    Match Requests: Check if the incoming request URL starts with /api/v1/todos.
    Delegate Handling: Route the request to the todoRouter, which contains
       the route handlers for specific operations related to todos.

What Happens with This Setup
  Request to /api/v1/todos/: Will be handled by the route router.get('/') in todoRouter.
  Request to /api/v1/todos/123: Will be handled by the route router.get('/:id') in todoRouter, where 123 is the id parameter.
  Request to /api/v1/todos with POST method: Will be handled by the route router.post('/') in todoRouter.
